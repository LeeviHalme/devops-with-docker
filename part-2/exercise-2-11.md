For this exercise, I chose to showcase my project for the Intermediate Studies Project: Database Application -course. The project was a web application that was built using the Django framework.

Link to the project: [https://github.com/LeeviHalme/online-course-manager](https://github.com/LeeviHalme/online-course-manager)

Development docker-compose.yml: [https://github.com/LeeviHalme/online-course-manager/blob/main/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/LeeviHalme/online-course-manager/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

I chose to use docker compose for this project because it made it easy to set up the development environment. I also didn't want to install postgres for my local machine.
