I used render.com to host the course material. The course material is available at [https://dowd-course-material.onrender.com/](https://dowd-course-material.onrender.com/).

The dockerfile is unmodified copy from `devopsdockeruh/coursepage`.

I created a new web service on render.com and connected it to the Docker Hub repository. Setup was straightforward and the service was up and running in a few minutes.
